### **Fix Summary**
1. **Ensure the table is correctly formatted**  
   - Pipes `|` must align correctly to avoid rendering issues.  
2. **Ensure the table appears at the very top of the README**  
   - If too far down, users must scroll to see it.  
3. **Remove `{target="_blank"}`**  
   - GitHub **does not support this** in Markdown.
