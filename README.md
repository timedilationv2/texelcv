## TexelCV | Facial Texture Analysis for Deepfake Detection

**TexelCV** is an advanced prototype utilizing **Computer Vision (CV)** technology specifically designed to detect deepfake-generated faces using sophisticated **Facial Texture Analysis** techniques.

TexelCV employs multiple layers of analysis including facial texture anomalies, GAN fingerprints, and behavioral inconsistencies (like unnatural blinking patterns) to provide robust, real-time detection capabilities.
