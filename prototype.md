## TexelCV Prototype Concept

The **TexelCV Prototype** demonstrates a novel approach to detecting manipulated media through detailed **Facial Texture Analysis**.

### How It Works

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Image Input** | User uploads an image or video stream. |
| **Facial Extraction** | Faces are detected and cropped using OpenCV. |
| **Texture Analysis** | Analysis of facial textures, GAN fingerprints, and blink rates. |
| **Result** | Generation of confidence score indicating authenticity. |
